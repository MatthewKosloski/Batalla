# Batalla

A battleship game built with React and Socketio.  Commit messages are less than useful and are subpar in nature.  Although this is a bad practice, I believe exceptions can be made for this project.  I'm the only one working on the repo, and I merely need a place to put my code.

## Setup

1. Install node modules.
  ```js
    $ npm install
  ```
  
2. Install Bower components.
  ```js
    $ bower install
  ```
  
3. Run Gulp to compile HTML and CSS.
  ```js
    $ gulp
  ```
  
4. Run the server.
  ```js
    $ npm start
  ```

5. Run Webpack (in new tab).
  ```js
    $ npm run webpack
  ```

## Production

1. Replace JS source in HTML to minified version.

2. Compile HTML and CSS.
  ```js
    $ gulp build
  ```

3. Compile JavaScript with Webpack.
  ```js
    $ npm run build
  ```
